# Maiduo groupbuy App


This repo contains the code for a RESTful API groupbuy App that was built using the MEAN stack:

<ul>
<li>MongoDB</li>
<li>Express</li>
<li>AngularJS</li>
<li>NodeJS</li>
</ul>



<h3>Instructions</h3>

clone repo

    git clone git@github.com:froster2006/meanstacktutorial.git

then install the Node modules with

    npm install

then install the bower dependencies in public folder with

    bower install
    
if run into connection git errors, run this before bower install

    git config --global url."https://".insteadOf git://

then make sure MongoDB is running with

    mongod

from your MongoDB directory, and then run the code with 

    node server

You might see a message that says, 

    Error: Module did not self-register.]
    js-bson: Failed to load c++ bson extension, using pure JS version
    
Don't worry about this; the code will still work.
