# Maiduo groupbuy App
<h2>Maiduo groupbuy App/h2>


This repo contains the code for a RESTful API groupbuy App that was built using the MEAN stack:

<ul>
<li>MongoDB</li>
<li>Express</li>
<li>AngularJS</li>
<li>NodeJS</li>
</ul>



<h3>Instructions</h3>

clone repo

    git clone git@github.com:froster2006/meanstacktutorial.git

then install the Node modules with

    npm install

then install the bower dependencies in public folder with

    bower install

then make sure MongoDB is running with

    mongod

from your MongoDB directory, and then run the code with 

    node server

You might see a message that says, 

    Error: Module did not self-register.]
    js-bson: Failed to load c++ bson extension, using pure JS version
    
Don't worry about this; the code will still work.

<h3>Have fun!</h3>
